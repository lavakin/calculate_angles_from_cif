# Calculate angles from cif file
Project made for a [conformer research](https://blackbox.ibt.biocev.org/devel/conformers_cif.php?cifcode=1hmh) for the lab of Jiří Černý of the Institute of Biotechnology of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

The program takes a cif file of DNA structure as an argument, calculates diheral angles and returns a csv and json file with angles and other properties of the molecule.
